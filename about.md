Hi, thanks for visiting my GitHub page. I am a software engineer currently working for Citrix R&D, Bangalore, India. I am quite passionate about technology in general and I have worked on quite a lot of different things, ranging from trying to write my operating system to game development. I am also interested in algorithms and data structures.

**For Recruiters:** As a professional software developer, I am always looking for difficult problems to tackle. It doesn't matter if it is writing a web application in Python or writing a new computer language in Rust, if it is interesting enough I would want to work on it :smile:. Please refer to my resume to see if I am a good fit to your organization.
